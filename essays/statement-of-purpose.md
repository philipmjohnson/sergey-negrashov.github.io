Sensor networks are taking on a new face in an advent of the Internet of Things. Topologies which relied on mesh networked radios are being quickly with the end-to-end TCP/IP based devices. This trend continues as the semiconductor companies are introducing ever more integrated WIFI chip-sets, which combine analog and digital circuitry with an embedded CPU core in a singe package. These devices are able to run for months or even years on batteries, and are quickly displacing traditional radio chip-sets.  Furthermore, cheap Linux single board computers are filling the gap for IOT applications which require significant DSP resources. The leap in technology that powered IOT is now making its way into traditional sensor networks and distributed measurements. 


Many projects in literature develop IP based distributed measurement networks, hardly any of them operate in environments where a single instrument signal to noise ratio is bellow 1...
